Canvas Pong
===========

This is a mod to allow 2D pong. Currently only enabled on part5 for single player mode.

This is a branch of a small experiment to implement a version of the classic Pong game in an HTML <canvas>.


NOTES
=====

 * No support for mobile devices (need to handle touch events instead of key input)
